<h2>Categories <%= link_to image_tag("add.gif"), new_category_path %></h2>

Categories are a way to organize sources.  You can define a category for 
your sources by editing a source.

<ul>
<% for category in @categories %>
  <li>
    <h3><%= link_to h(category.name), category %></h3>
    <ul>
      <% category.sources.each do |source| %>
        <li><%= link_to h(source.name), source_path(source) %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
  </li>
<% end %>
</ul>
