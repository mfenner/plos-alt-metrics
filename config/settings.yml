# A Site key gives additional protection against a dictionary attack if your DB
# is ever compromised.  With no site key, we store DB_password =
# hash(user_password, DB_user_salt) If your database were to be compromised
# you'd be vulnerable to a dictionary attack on all your stupid users'
# passwords.  With a site key, we store DB_password = hash(user_password,
# DB_user_salt, Code_site_key) That means an attacker needs access to both your
# site's code *and* its database to mount an "offline dictionary
# attack.":http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/web-authentication.html
# 
# It's probably of minor importance, but recommended by best practices:
# 'defense in depth'.  Needless to say, if you upload this to github or the
# youtubes or otherwise place it in public view you'll kinda defeat the point.
# Your users' passwords are still secure, and the world won't end, but
# defense_in_depth -= 1.
# 
# Please note: if you change this, all the passwords will be invalidated, so DO
# keep it someplace secure.  Use the random value given or type in the lyrics
# to your favorite Jay-Z song or something; any moderately long, unpredictable
# text.
  
# Repeated applications of the hash make brute force (even with a compromised
# database and site key) harder, and scale with Moore's law.
#
#   bq. "To squeeze the most security out of a limited-entropy password or
#   passphrase, we can use two techniques [salting and stretching]... that are
#   so simple and obvious that they should be used in every password system.
#   There is really no excuse not to use them." http://tinyurl.com/37lb73
#   Practical Security (Ferguson & Scheier) p350
# 
# A modest 10 foldings (the default here) adds 3ms.  This makes brute forcing
# 10 times harder, while reducing an app that otherwise serves 100 reqs/s to 78
# signin reqs/s, an app that does 10reqs/s to 9.7 reqs/s
