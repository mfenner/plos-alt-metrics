Capistrano
==========

This installation guide uses [Capistrano](http://capify.org), the best
practice tool for deploying Rails projects.

Capistrano is a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.

To get Capistrano:

    gem install capistrano

Capistrano is configured to deploy to `/opt/alm`, owned by the system user
`alm`. Within that directory, Capistrano will set up a timstamp-named folder
(for example, "201003140292") for the current version of the ALM application,
and symlinking `/opt/alm/current` to it. This allows multiple versions of
the application to sit on the machine at a time, simplifying rollback if
necessary. More information on capistrano can be found at <http://capify.org>.

Capistrano also creates a `/opt/alm/shared` directory to hold a few
configuration files that shouldn't be checked into source control because they
contain database passwords & secret keys. Capistrano will take care of the
process of deploying a new version of the application that includes linking
these files into the current-version tree in the right spots.

    # Make sure to add your ssh public keys to /opt/alm/.ssh/authorized_keys.

    # Logout to your local machine and use capistrano to do a first
    # deploy. Edit the config/deploy.rb file to point to the machine you're
    # trying to deploy to.
    vi config/deploy.rb
    cap deploy:setup
    cap deploy

    # Capistrano will ssh and use svn to checkout a version of the application
    # to /opt/alm (specified in config/deploy.rb). ssh back into the machine
    # and change to the deployed directory.
    cd /opt/alm/current

    # On first deploy, Capistrano will also have copied the sample
    # configuration files into the correct spot (/opt/alm/shared/config) and
    # symlinked them (to /opt/alm/current/config). This is so that they
    # don't change via deploys. Modify them at:
    /opt/alm/shared/config/database.yml
    /opt/alm/shared/config/settings.yml

    # Capistrano can be used to redeploy changes to the application
    cap deploy

    # If there are database migrations, use deploy:migrations
    cap deploy:migrations
